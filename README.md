## General Info 
`Kenji Battle` was created to see if a game could be made using only HTML and JavaScript. It is a 2 player fighting game, where the players are either Samurai Mack or Kenji. They battle eachother using `AWD + SPACE` and `Arrow Keys` Respectively. This project was done along side a youtube tutorial.

## Goals
- Using only HTML Canvas and Javascript implement a  UI that displays player sprites
- Begin implementing game logic:
    - movement
    - timer
    - health
    - hit box
    - attack
    - timer
    - win conditions
- Add sprites for characters and background
- deploy the finished product
